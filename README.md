# Shapes2D Application<br/>
> [!NOTE]
> The major assessment item for CAB302 is an application that solves a real world problem, written using the Java programing language. Students will form development teams of five (5) students, and will be required to incoporate Agile prinicples and values into their project management strategy. The project requirements will be dicussed in detail in the coming weeks. However, a definte requirement will be the use of Object Oriented Programming design principles.

The four pillars of OOP are:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritence
4. Polymorphism
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not completed the Week 1 Readings for CAB302 on Canvas, I would strongly suggest completion of Activity 1.1 - Reading: Object Oriented Programming in Java as all of these concepts are discussed in detail with example code.<br/>

## Introduction
In this first practical we will revise OOP design principles. For some students it will reinforce their OOP knowledge/application. For others, it will hopefully identify gaps in knowledge that require additional study and attention.
The task this week is the implementation of an application that models 2 dimensional shapes, performs operations of these shape objects, and displays specific properties about these shapes. To enable implementation of the required classes a UML Class Diagram has been provided. This UML Class diagram is shown in figure 1 below. 

> [!TIP]
> If you are unfamiliar with UML Class Diagrams (UML === Unified Modelling Language) then refer to the **UML Class Diagram Essentials** on Canvas - Activity 1.3
